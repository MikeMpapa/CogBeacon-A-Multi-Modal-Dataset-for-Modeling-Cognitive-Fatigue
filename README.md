# CogBeacon-A-Multi-Modal-Dataset-for-Modeling-Cognitive-Fatigue
CogBeacon is a multi-modal dataset designed to target the effects of cognitive fatigue in human performance. The dataset consists of 76 sessions collected from 19 male and female users performing different versions of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST); a popular cognitive test in experimental and clinical psychology designed to assess cognitive flexibility, reasoning and specific aspects of cognitive functioning. During each session we record and fully annotate, user's EEG functionality, facial keypoints, real-time self-reports on cognitive fatigue, as well as detailed information of the performance metrics achieved during the cognitive task (success rate, response time, number of errors etc.). Along with the dataset we provide a baseline Machine Learning analysis towards predicting cognitive fatigue and our multi-modal implementation of the WCST, to allow other researches expand or modify the functionalities of the CogBeacon data-collection framework. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal dataset specifically designed to assess cognitive fatigue.
